Hi **@dreamatic-tech**!

I am sure I fit this position. I am experienced in all points, which you are listing in job description. I made UX research, designed layouts and prototypes, created design systems, and launched products from scratch. I led design team and provided the soil for collaboration for other teams. My work definitely increased the position on the market for Sberbank. I can code.

My portfolio you can find here:

Password for NDA projects: knockknock 

In addition to my portfolio, I would like to share some further examples that showcase my past experience in UI design. My apologies for presenting this collection of images without a detailed context. I have shared them in this manner to streamline the process.
